# example
A skeleton plugin for use with dars.

## How to use plugins
* Make a folder with the plugin's content **called the plugin's name**.

* For example, the example.py and all the other files in a given plugin would go in a folder called **example**.

* Then that folder is placed in the plugins folder of your dars project.

* Finally, edit your `config.yml` and add in the section:
    plugins:
      - [plugin folder name]
      
* Voila!
